# ðŸš€ v2025.1.4 ðŸš€

## Changelog

### ðŸŽ¯ Core

- âœ¨ **Fileserver Plugin**: The Fileserver plugin has been restored to the standard bundle because of the resolution of all CVEs in its dependency, `GoFiber`.
- âœ¨ **Green Tea Garbage Collector**: The Green Tea garbage collector has been disabled by default after receiving several bug reports related to its use. For more details, see the [Go RFC](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/73581).
- âœ¨ **Automaxprocs**: The `automaxprocs` library from Uber has been removed, as Go 1.25 now includes this functionality natively.
