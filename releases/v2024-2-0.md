# Upgrade guide: [link](https://docs.roadrunner.dev/docs/general/compatibility#upgrading-to-roadrunner-v2024.2.x)

## Community plugins

We are introducing a new term in the RoadRunner community â€” Community plugins. 
If you have a brilliant idea for HTTP middleware, a JOBS driver, or even a new plugin, feel free to check our 
[Customization](../customization) tutorials, create and notify us about your plugin.

## Plugins updates:

### ðŸ”¥ Meet the new JOBS driver - Google Pub/Sub
RoadRunner now supports Google Pub/Sub queues. This driver is currently in **BETA** and has a few limitations, which you can find in the docs.

### `AMQP` and `Kafka` JOBS drivers

- ðŸ”¥ Support auto-restarting the pipeline on redial or fatal connection problems to the RabbitMQ broker. Instead of silently exiting the pipeline, RR will try to re-initialize it.

Thanks to our PHP team, [KV](https://github.com/roadrunner-php/kv/releases/tag/v4.3.0) now has `AsyncStorageInterface` support which makes your experience with the KV plugin even faster.
Feel free to read the technical details here: [link](https://github.com/roadrunner-php/goridge/pull/22)

### Samples repository

- ðŸ”¥ Our RoadRunner samples repository was updated and now includes a `Jobs` driver example for the `Jobs` plugin.
More info here: [link](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/samples).


### Our Go-SDK was deprecated

- ðŸ˜­ Our Go-SDK was deprecated and split into separate packages. Read more in the Upgrade guide.


### Velox configuration update

- ðŸ”¥ Velox configuration was simplified:

```yaml
[roadrunner]
# ref -> reference, tag, commit or branch
ref = "v2024.2.0"

# the debug option is used to build RR with debug symbols to profile it with pprof
[debug]
enabled = false

## Rest is the same ....
```

Now, there is no need to include linker flags, and the build time and version are inherited automatically.
If you need to debug your binary, set the `debug` option to `true`.
