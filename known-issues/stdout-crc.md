# Invalid message sent to STDOUT

This message `validation failed on the message sent to STDOUT, RR docs: https://docs.roadrunner.dev/docs, invalid message: ...` means that you or some application sent a non-correct message (raw) to the `STDOUT`.  
Process `STDOUT` is reserved for the RR communication with the PHP process via the `goridge` protocol (`v3`).

How to fix that?  

1. Check your application. All dependencies should send their messages to the `STDERR` instead of `STDOUT`. You may see the output after the `invalid message`. It might be shrunk on `windows`.
2. Check `dd` , `echo` inserted by you. PHP workers can redirect `echo` automatically from the `STDOUT` to `STDERR` but only after the worker is initialized fully.
3. Worker from the RRv1 was used. To update, see: [link](../integration/migration.md)
4. OPcache is enabled with JIT, but some extensions don't support it, which leads to the warnings. Tune the `error_reporting` configuration option (use only errors): [issue](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/1306)
5. If you use a Symfony runtime, do not forget to add `APP_RUNTIME` to the server environment variables, as described here: https://github.com/php-runtime/roadrunner-symfony-nyholm.
