# Allocate timeout error

RoadRunner allocates workers like usual processes (via `fork` + `exec` syscalls). While RoadRunner is in the process of creating a worker (connecting to the pipes, TCP, etc.), some part of the worker might freeze the initial handshake. RoadRunner waits `pool.allocate_timeout` time for handshake to complete and return this error if `pool.allocate_timeout` exceeded.

How to fix that?  

1. Check the `pool.allocate_timeout` option. It should be in the form of `pool.allocate_timeout: 1s` or `pool.allocate_timeout: 1h`, so you should specify the units of measurement. Also, keep in mind, that `1s` for the allocate timeout might be a very small value, try to increase it.
2. `xdebug` might freeze the worker spawn while improperly configured. See this tutorial: [link](../php/debugging.md)
3. If you use a server's relay other than `pipes`, check [this options](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/blob/master/.rr.yaml#L75). It's responsible for the initial handshake timeout between RR and PHP process established via `sockets` or `TCP`.
